		<h4>
			Mom 
		</h4>
		<p>My mom was born in a little village  in 1930.</p>
<p>Her mom was a very strong woman,  who, despite the limitations placed on her by the political and
economic situations at the time,  created he own business. She imported
coffee beans from Africa, roasted and sugar coated them to sell to the
travellers passing by. She created the brand of elephant coffees. Her dad
was a soldier, and she tells me he liked to build things and how a sweet man
he was. 
</p> 
<p> She had two sisters, one older and one younger.  As children they
used to play with the sacks of coffee beans, jumping on them and making
shapes with them. The house always smelt of fresh coffee and freshly ironed
linen. 
</p>  
<p>Later in life, she met my dad and moved to Mozambique, where I was
born a few years later.  She taught kids to read and write. She was an
amazingly dedicated teacher, who always encouraged me to learn, and discover
new things. We played with words and numbers every night. Often she would put
me to bed and read to me from books, and then she would stop at the most
interesting part, and switch off the lights. I would pretend to settle and
wait for her to leave, then I would read more until falling asleep, tired
between the pages.  
</p>  
<p> My mom likes red, blue and purple. She also likes to
write letters, say the odd Latin phrase, and make drawings of mice, ducks and
a bear riding a monocycle.  She has used the same hair brush for 30 years,
and refuses to use newer and better models I have given to her. She also
likes pencils which she orders in lines and by colour.  I liked my mom's
hands and her nails varnished in pearly colours. I still like them wrinkled
and tired. 
</p>  
<p>She always wears pearls and polka dot dresses with lots of dots
and pretty pearls.   At eighty she joined the university to learn computers
and philosophy. She loves her iPad with red covers.  She changed from using
the pencils, to touching keys on a glass; her phone to a button that opens a
window inside my home. She has even done a film of me playing silly. 
</p>  
<p>My mom does not understand what I do, but what matters is that we are friends. You
make me happy. Good night mom.</p> <br>

		<h4>
			Notes to self before directing a film (unedited... sort of)
		</h4>
		<img src="images/film.jpg" alt="film" height="257" width="360"> 
		<p>
			<em>Zipedidudahhh</em> … thanks to <a href="http://www.raindance.org/author/patrick-tucker/" target="_blank">Patrick Tucker </a>who kindly shared his experience, humour and loveliness with me: <br>
		<blockquote>
			As a director you only have to know what you want. Don't be limited by reality. Be unafraid to tell what you want. Directors direct and react to creative talent. 
			</p>
			Cast the most talented, not for looks. Talent will always ' look right' Be deeply whatever . Be yourself +. Not someone else 
		</blockquote>
		<br>
		<p>
			The audiences like to see the gear changes. In real life we have many unanswered questions. 
		</p>
		<p>
			You don’t always have to speak grammatically – we all understand what they mean when a public figure says something like “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” However, we do raise an eyebrow (or at least some of us do) if we hear “Please give the information to John or to I.” The incorrect grammar jars, is not meant as a joke but is a mistake, and for a short time our brains are taken up with working out what they should have said, and so we sometimes miss what they are actually saying now.
		</p>
		<p>
			The same goes for film grammar.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Films with turning points: ‘The apartment’ ‘Gone with the wind’ ‘Casablanca’ ‘The matrix’ ‘Notorious’
		</p>
		<p>
			People need to understand what the contract is, are they going to get the answers or if they will have to make their choice. Bad film grammar makes people get not involved. We have to be particularly careful to keep them involved. 
		</p>
		
		Directors must always ask themselves: Why did this happen? Directors must know because they are the conduit between the author and the audience. What actors are thinking is not what the audience gets. See Interview with John Malcovich on ‘Side by side’ 'People see what they see' The craft of a director is to make people do what he/she wants them to do. Happy people work better. <br>
		Don't rely on CGI tweaks. Tell the story with pictures rather than words <br>
		Tip carry at all times eye drops for tears, good for children. Squeeze a drop and roll. <br>
		<br>
		<p>
			There are two types of journeys: or the character changes or the audience change. I want to make the second type of films <br>
			The easiest thing on the world is to play a loony and you get Oscars. <br>
			If you want to be a good director, direct well. You do it for yourself, no matter what material you have to shoot. You create the habit of doing things well. Throw yourself fully to the work you do. Don't think that it is just an episode of Emmerdale. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Don't follow your actors too much, just let them release their talent, but keep focus on what you want. <br>

		</p>
		<p>Tip: carry at all times eye drops for tears</p> 

		<h5>
			Technology
		</h5>
		Insist for a big monitor in colour. Get 2 sources of sound always! Because of technology we can speed things up not just for effect eg.The town, green wing, nikita, the glass house. <br>
		<h5>
			Lighting
		</h5>
		When panning across the window... Easier to have lights on a stand. You may consider make the actors provide the motivation for placing back lights or field lights. Make them move! That will be appreciated by the DOP <br>
		<h5>
			Camera angles
		</h5>
		Lego has the superb extra value of having little men as part of the blocks they provide, and these can also be moved about the set to see how moves work out. For the camera it is especially useful to be able to put combination of actors down, and look at them from different angles, working out the best way to present them to camera. <br>
		<h5>
			Editing
		</h5>
		Directors think we editors are weirdos locked in dark rooms that live like vampires drinking terabytes. It is not true… they are your best friends and you should marry them for the duration of the project. Don't cut too early. I think it is a good idea to ask the camera person to cut after I say cut. Lots of magic stuff happens when actors relax which can be useful for editing. To repeat a scene medium to close shot don't cut from one to another. Keep the camera rolling and go immediately for a close shot. Better continuity! It also works when lines are wrong. Give actors the queue and keep rolling. Editing will do the cuts. Pick up shots: the scene continues rolling and can be repeated then edited. It is a good idea to tell the crew that you are intending to do that. Don't cut too early. Think about the editing. Also cutting gives you pace. Some experienced actors are aware of editing… capture their reactions to what is being said, Al Pacino and Robert de Niro are very good at telling the story just with facial expressions. A good example is the interview for a caterer in ‘Shining’ where Jack Nicholson does an amazing performance for the camera. <br>
		<h5>
			Overlaps
		</h5>
		Tell the actors if it is a contained or cross cutting shoot. Because of widescreen you can now do split shots. Don’t forget to tell the sound guy beforehand. The radio mike should only be used as a back up. Everything is possible...swings and balances. The realities of shooting are that you must find a way to make your idea work like an architect of solutions. <br>
		<h5>
			Sound
		</h5>
		The sound guy is often invisible… keep acknowledging your awareness of him/her. Always thank the boom operator. The sound is most important. The sound track to be dubbed needs independent tracks of atmosphere / fooley /etc. don't forget to record enough wild tracks including recording the silence. Doing live is always better and cheaper than post production. Always plan for it beforehand. <br>
		<h5>
			The team
		</h5>
		No one will give up power willingly. Everyone wants to have their contribution seen on screen. Consider all details. Beware of actors ego. Make up and costumes and props, all is important. Make friends with sound guy. You can be secret partners to 'go again for sound' to cover for actors mistakes... Makes them feel more comfortable. If you have babies crying don't shoot their face. People know they are not acting and feel uncomfortable. With children or animals use a second camera following them all the time. Acknowledge every single element of the crew. Also actors. And Bob… <br>
		<h5>
			Others
		</h5>
		Don't trust script editors, the link between the producers and the author. They lie and cheat. Casting directors have their own agendas. Don’t accept a no lightly… do your own work. The make up is the channel of unofficial communication between actors and directors. Always go to them at the end of the shoot to find what actors feel and want. First assistants rarely get to be good directors. They do a hard job. Let them manage the extras. Observe. There may be jewels there. <br>
		<h5>
			Single developing shot:
		</h5>
		<p>
			See ‘Touch of evil’ opening sequence. ‘The player’ a Robert Altman film <br>
			‘Bonfire of the vanities’ by Brian de Palma <br>
			Single developing shots can serve to save time, give a geographical reference or to impress and show off to the world... Look mom how clever I am! I actually like them in the beginning with credits because it can be a very useful device to set the story without the conventions associated to cuts. <br>
			3 month took to do the single developing shot ‘Tom-yum goong’ .. fight over 3 floors Hitchcock on ‘stage fright’ uses a single developing shot as a subtle way to say : dont believe what you see. He uses a lie in a flashback using asingle developing shot . The scene and technique is unbelievably good... Matching in a very clever way the plot. Genius! ‘Nine lives’ uses single developing shot to develop performances. Short stories all in one shot. ‘Russian ark’ 2002 all in one shot ‘Lady in the lake’ ‘Rope’ ‘Time code’ Children of men balance between amazing planning and go with the flow and finally ‘Atonement’ - Dunkirk scene amazing piece of directing.
		</p>
		<h5>
			Art
		</h5>
		<p>
			We don't live in a symmetrical world Interesting shots on a closed space: ‘12 angry men’

			Family reflections
		</h4>

			In black &amp; white
		</p>
		<p>
			My dad was born in 1930 in Paialvo, a little village in the countryside of Portugal. He adored above all his two daughters Belita and Vandinha. He is sweet, romantic, and extremely generous. I don't know much about his childhood other that he didn't like broad beans. Perhaps my sister can tell me more

		<h4>
			Puzzling Out the Creativity Stories

			Rickards (1999) summarises the history of creativity based on the foregoing description:

			Creativity history (Source adapted from Rickards (1999:35))<a href="#cite_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> The workers can be split into three main groupings: labellers, measurers and experimenters, and creative problem – solving change agents. Rhodes and Wallas are clearly labelers, with Koester also fitting in this group. Bogan and Sperry, Torrance and Guilford were experimenters and measurers, widely recognized by their research methods. Osborn, de Bono and Gordon are examples of change agents who pioneered structured creativity techniques<a href="#cite_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a>. In some contrast, Amabile represents a shift towards a newer perspective that has been gaining credibility. Its essence is a belief that individuals behave under the influence of social context in which they are embedded. Her extrinsic motivation theory requires us to recognize the influence imposed by extrinsic forces. The strong radical humanist streak can be found in a shared belief that creativity exists as a universal human characteristic that is open to nurture and development. Osborn wanted to liberate the creative spark that we all possess. This belief was strongly implied in the works of Guilford, Torrance, Gordon and De Bono. There is a suppressed view found in the ten stories that the individual human efforts can make a difference to their futures. This philosophy accords with the possibility of someone ‘creating’ the future, rather than having their lives pre-determined way.

			Love and freedom
		</h4>
		<br>
		<p>
			Redmamba is a child, simple but deep. Simple in the things that make like complicated like possessions and people
		</p>
		<p>
			Redmamba’s life is lived here and yet it is not. It is a silent existence moving behind the words, it is a life of steel and solitude.
		</p>
		<p>
			Beyond the visible softness is a force of values that the world can never break, for Redmamba a minute can hold a thousand years, for she measures things by love.
		</p>
		<p>
			Redmamba is a free person and yet belongs to a group. It is a life based on dying firmly, slowly and forever...

		<h4>
			I failed again
		</h4>
		<p>
			Looking at my goals this year, I have failed so far:
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>My health</strong> — I eat healthy most of the time, but I get occasional gluttony moments and I overeat keeping my weight a bit above the optimum level. I do not do enough exercise and I carry heavy bags all the time. I need to sleep more. Perhaps I need a ruthless timetable to discipline myself…
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Procrastination</strong> — Some people say that if you care about something you just do it. I want desperately to learn the basics of developing useful stuff on the web and produce films. Why I am I not doing that as frequently as I would like to feel content? Sometimes it is because the task has a lot of barriers to actually starting, like needing certain conditions or information that I don’t immediately have. And that takes time. and then family, friends, keeping the house feeling like home, cooking and shopping get on the way of what I really want to be doing. Why? I guess I need to work on the next topic.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>NO</strong> — Though I think is one of the best tools to deliver stuff and lead a minimalist life, I keep the doors of my life open to disruption. I must be more self centred. I must use 'NO' as my mantra.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Expectations</strong> — while I keep watch on them, I still have them, and still feel frustrated/disappointed/sad when people don’t meet them. I manage to keep them to myself. That is an achievement. Onwards. Onwards.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Simplicity</strong> — I’m not as minimalist as I would like. I need to pay more attention to two things: 1. Eliminate 2. Use remaining stuff as a trustee totally detached from feelings of ownership.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Learning</strong> — I love to learn new things. I have done many courses and never excelled at anything. I dropped learning languages and programming and other things like this, mostly because I’ve found I just don’t have enough time to seriously learn stuff and still do the other things that are important to me. This is not making me happier. I am going to focus this year on only three things: Coding, making short films, writing here.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am taking one little step today. I have decided to make a film every month, to post a note here every week
		</p>

		<h4>
			It's not me
		</h4>
		<p>
			I look trough the mirror and it is not me. I feel increasingly distant from the actor 'me', the one who has family, friends, a job, a home, a pillow, a bike and several cards that identify me as number out of 7 billion other actors. I spend most of my precious time playing different roles and pretending that I am a humanoid that conforms with the basic rules of society and performs the basic rites of social interaction with other human beings. Too much time to keep a mountain of illusions alive in mine and people's imaginary lives. A huge price to pay? I think so. It is not worth it. Not worth to live other people's lives and the roles they expect from me. I am tired to be a clown. Enough!
		</p>
		<p>
			I belong to this side of the mirror, the real me, the one no one wants to know or have time for, the one who knows and has experienced things that are unbelievable and illogical. Who believes…, er, no, believe is not the word, knows… oh that sounds patronising, see there you are again falling into the trap of 'the others'. Sounds… to whom? Why should I care to make myself understood, believed or respected? I live on this side of the mirror alone. Here there is not 'sounds', no 'feels' no 'action' no audience. There is nobody here. Just me and an ocean of me stuff. Still. Quiet. Observing.
		</p>
		<p>
			Jumping between worlds is becoming more difficult than ever. When I cross the mirror and I see other people so trapped in the roles they play, I fall into the trap of pretending to be one of them. Sometimes it looks nice to be admired for being good at something, having others who like us, to use nice shinny things. I become an animation powered by a zombie like mass delusion, behaving like Mickey Mouse: one moment running around happy and the next sad and disappointed. It is all smoking mirrors. If I throw a stone of who I really am, it all shatters in a thousand pieces of expectations. They don't really see 'me'. They see the clown. It is not real. It is not mine, I don't belong there.
		</p>
		<p>
			Well it is another day, I must cross the mirror again, the show must begin and the truth is not my friend out there…
		</p>

		<h4>
			People
		</h4>
		<p>
			I have been thinking about the people I have met in my life. Recently Karl Pilkington said we only need to have 7 friends in our life. I always resisted to accept the variable of time in what I call friends. But today I was thinking about stats. How many people I kept in touch regularly for the last 7 years? Not colleagues... people who really care about me and know about my happy moments, my difficult times, that are there for me if I go to hospital? That are free tomorrow if I need a hug? Two? One? So much time spent in building relationships and they all come and go. Sixteen years of marriage and intense bonding go up in smoke in a couple of months. I come to the conclusion that time reveals a lot, not all about how solid your companions in life are. Voluntarily, not because of social commitments or old promises. Because we like to, we want to. People do what they want to and each journey and choices are individual and must be respected beyond words and expectations. Perhaps the idea of a friend is just a romantic illusion. Today is what counts, past and future is irrelevant. This thought makes me uncomfortable. I like the feeling of belonging, of creating life together, of loyalty, of companionship and freedom.

		<h4>
			Writing
		</h4>
		<p>
			My writing is so bad, I am glad no one is reading this. Despite these notes being for myself, I must do something about improving my writing skills. I don't think doing it again and again alone will improve it magically. It may just solidify what is already crappy. Hummm.... I would like to read them again when I am 60 years old and should provide myself with a more pleasant reading experience!

		<h4>
			Words
		</h4>
		<p>
			Here's Orwell's essay on Politics and the English Language, with the <a href="https://t.co/KcPnm0Ar" title="six essential rules">word rules</a> at the end:
		</p>
		<ul id="word-rules">
			<li>Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.</li>
			<li>Never use a long word where a short one will do.</li>
			<li>If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.</li>
			<li>Never use the passive where you can use the active.</li>
			<li>Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.</li>
			<li>Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

		5 July 2013 
		<h4>
			Manifesto
		</h4>
		<p>
			<strong>Ask stupid questions:</strong> Growth is fueled by desire and innocence. Explore the answer and filter ego and personal agendas. Pick the hidden jewels.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Drift:</strong> Allow yourself to wander aimlessly. Explore unplanned life. Lack judgement. Postpone criticism.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Jump fences:</strong> Disciplinary boundaries and bureaucratic regimes are doomed attempts to control the wilding of creative life... ignore
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Live today as the only one</strong>: There are no second chances in life
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Say NO:</strong> don't try to resuscitate dead horses, don't accumulate clutter
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Be Humble</strong>: a great person shows his/hers greatness by the way he/she treats little men
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Believe:</strong> in dreams and in love there are no impossibilities
