<p>My mom was born in a little village  in 1930.</p>
<p>Her mom was a very strong woman,  who, despite the limitations placed on her by the political and
economic situations at the time,  created he own business. She imported
coffee beans from Africa, roasted and sugar coated them to sell to the
travellers passing by. She created the brand of elephant coffees. Her dad
was a soldier, and she tells me he liked to build things and how a sweet man
he was. 
</p> 
<p> She had two sisters, one older and one younger.  As children they
used to play with the sacks of coffee beans, jumping on them and making
shapes with them. The house always smelt of fresh coffee and freshly ironed
linen. 
</p>  
<p>Later in life, she met my dad and moved to Mozambique, where I was
born a few years later.  She taught kids to read and write. She was an
amazingly dedicated teacher, who always encouraged me to learn, and discover
new things. We played with words and numbers every night. Often she would put
me to bed and read to me from books, and then she would stop at the most
interesting part, and switch off the lights. I would pretend to settle and
wait for her to leave, then I would read more until falling asleep, tired
between the pages.  
</p>  
<p> My mom likes red, blue and purple. She also likes to
write letters, say the odd Latin phrase, and make drawings of mice, ducks and
a bear riding a monocycle.  She has used the same hair brush for 30 years,
and refuses to use newer and better models I have given to her. She also
likes pencils which she orders in lines and by colour.  I liked my mom's
hands and her nails varnished in pearly colours. I still like them wrinkled
and tired. 
</p>  
<p>She always wears pearls and polka dot dresses with lots of dots
and pretty pearls.   At eighty she joined the university to learn computers
and philosophy. She loves her iPad with red covers.  She changed from using
the pencils, to touching keys on a glass; her phone to a button that opens a
window inside my home. She has even done a film of me playing silly. 
</p>  
<p>My mom does not understand what I do, but what matters is that we are friends. You
make me happy. Good night mom.</p> <br>
